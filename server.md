"Nintendo Dream Catcher" refers to a set of map editing and scripting tools that were supposed to make modding Nintendo 64 games easy and accessible for casual players. It is unknown which one of Nintendo's developer teams was responsible for it and its existence has been uncovered only recently by independent journalists who got their hands on a supposed prototype.

The software was supposedly planned to release on its own cartridge for around 100.000 Japanese Yen. The "prototype" package is said to have included a special Massive Memory Card with 64 megabytes of storage, that when successfully connected to the controller would trigger the game that's currently being played to display a message, offering the player to dump the assets of said game. After the user agreed, the game would freeze and a loading screen would appear while the file names of the assets would be displayed one after another to communicate progress to the user.

After this process another message would appear, asking the player to insert the "Dreamer Cartridge" and to not turn the console off under any circumstances. After following the instructions the player would be greeted with the Nintendo Dream Catcher interface, which is reported to look very organized and modern. A message would then tell the user that they now have access to all the assets of the previously dumped game and to: "have fun with them :)".
